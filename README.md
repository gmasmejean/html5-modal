# html5-modal
## Pure HTML5 & CSS Modals


These modals are designed to work without any piece of javascript.

**html5-modal** is an adaptable modal. Modal will always be vertically & horizontally centered.
Its size is automatically adapted to its content. If content is larger than viewport, modal becomes scrollable.

**html5-scrollable-modal** is also an adaptable modal. The main difference with **html5-modal** is that if content is higher than viewport, you can scroll on the viewport.
( Look like twitter modal )

## Browser support


Works pretty well on Chrome & Firefox, i didn't greatly test it yet :'(
